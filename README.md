# discord-bot
(Still in development)

Just my first work in VSCode. 

One day I desided to become a bot, but due it's impossibility, I made bot that can become ME.

Bot just replace your messages by theirs copy. Also tracks mentions of itself and message them to your DM. It can send and read DM messages as well (and send them to you).
To make it work, change token and ID in botconfig.json, and add it to some server.
